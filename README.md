# ISA-Server-TMG
Scripts for managing Microsoft ISA Server or Threat Management Gateway (TMG).

Many of these are not real projects, they are just code snippets from my six-day SANS Institute course on '[Securing Windows and PowerShell Automation (SEC505)'](https://sans.org/sec505) -- hope to see you there!  [@JasonFossen](https://twitter.com/JasonFossen)

(SEC505 has not included ISA/TMG coverage for many years though...)
